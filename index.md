In this course, we'll explore the implementation of **compilers**: programs that
transform source programs into other useful, executable forms. This will
include understanding syntax and its structure, checking for and representing
errors in programs, writing programs that generate code, and the interaction
of generated code with a runtime system.

We will explore these topics interactively in lecure, you will implement
an increasingly sophisticated series of compilers throughout the course to
learn how different language features are compiled, and you will think
through design challenges based on what you learn from implementation.
