In this course, we'll explore the implementation of **compilers**: programs that
transform source programs into other useful, executable forms. This will
include understanding syntax and its structure, checking for and representing
errors in programs, writing programs that generate code, and the interaction
of generated code with a runtime system.

We will explore these topics interactively in lecure, you will implement
an increasingly sophisticated series of compilers throughout the course to
learn how different language features are compiled, and you will think
through design challenges based on what you learn from implementation.

This web page serves as the main source of announcements and resources for the
course, as well as the syllabus.

## Basics

- Lecture: Center 109, 9am MWF
- Discussion: Center 119, 9am F

- Piazza: <a href="https://piazza.com/class/jfh8ukqgp5h521">https://piazza.com/class/jfh8ukqgp5h521</a>
- Gradescope: <a href="https://www.gradescope.com">https://www.gradescope.com</a> will be used for submissions (instructions will accompany the first programming assignment)
- Textbook/readings: There's no official textbook, but I'll link to different
  online resources for you to read to supplement lecture. Versions of this
  course have been taught at several universities, so sometimes I'll link to
  those instructor's materials, as well.

<a id="schedule">
## Schedule

The schedule below outlines topics, due dates, and links to assignments. In a
typical week, by *Monday before class* all due dates, readings, and notable
events in the course until the following week will be posted here. So if you
check the schedule at the beginning of the week, you'll know when all reading
quizzes, programming assignments, etc. will be due. We will often have the
schedule confirmed more than a week out, but we'll always be at least a week
ahead. The schedule of lecture topics might change slightly, but I post a
general plan so you can know roughly where we are headed.

(The first week is an exception; we'll get everything you need for the first
week out by Tuesday evening.)

## Staff & Resources

An office hours schedule will be posted here in the first week. If you have
immediate concerns, Joe has office hours from 1-2:30pm on Tuesday the first
week.

<a id="grading">
## Grading

Your grade will be calculated from:

- 5% participation via clickers
  - Each week both lecture and discussion will have clicker questions. You get
    credit for each session where you answer at least half of the questions.
  - Discussion attendance is not mandatory
- 5% review quizzes
  - Each week there will be an online review quiz, you get full review quiz
    credit for getting at least half the questions right
- 35% programming assignments (7-9 total)
- 20% take home written work
- 15% a midterm exam, in class
- 20% final exam
  - You must score over 50% on the final exam to pass the course
  - If you score higher on the final exam than on the midterm (including 0's on
    the midterm), the final applies at 35%
  - There are no make-up midterms; if you do not take the midterm, you get the
    same score on the midterm as you get on the final

## Policies

### Late Work

You have a total of 4 extension days that you can apply over the course of the
quarter. Any amount of time past the deadline counts as a full day. These apply
to programming assignments and to take-home work. You cannot use more than one
day on a given assignment.

### Regrades

Mistakes occur in grading. Once grades are posted for an assignment, we will
allow a short period for you to request a fix (announced along with grade
release). If you don't make a request in the given period, the grade you were
initially given is final.

### Exams

You are not allowed any study aids on in-class exams, aside from those
pertaining to university-approved accommodations. References will be provided
along with exams to avoid unnecessary memorization.

### Academic Integrity

The academic integrity policy for this course is similar to many other
programming-focused courses. A few notes specific to this course, to be clear:

- You cannot use or consult code from any student in this course or any other
  offering of this course in your solutions.
- You cannot use or consult code from anyone else or from online resources not
  explicitly allowed by the course in your solutions.
- You cannot provide or publish your solutions in a place where other students
  have access you.
- You cannot collaborate on assignments _except_ as explicitly allowed by
  certain assignments, which will be clearly marked.
- No student shall discuss the content or answers of any exam or quiz with any
  other student until after all the exams are graded and returned.  

All of the provisions in [the UCSD
guidelines](http://senate.ucsd.edu/Operating-Procedures/Senate-Manual/Appendices/2)
apply as well.

There may be exceptions to this policy posted clearly on individual assignments
to encourage and enable various kinds of collaboration. The default for
programming assignments is that they will be done individually, and exceptions
to this policy will be announced in advance.

### Diversity and Inclusion

We are committed to fostering a learning environment for this course that
supports a diversity of thoughts, perspectives and experiences, and respects
your identities (including race, ethnicity, heritage, gender, sex, class,
sexuality, religion, ability, age, educational background, etc.).  Our goal is
to create a diverse and inclusive learning environment where all students feel
comfortable and can thrive. 

Our instructional staff will make a concerted effort to be welcoming and
inclusive to the wide diversity of students in this course.  If there is a way
we can make you feel more included please let one of the course staff know,
either in person, via email/discussion board, or even in a note under the door.
Our learning about diverse perspectives and identities is an ongoing process,
and we welcome your perspectives and input.  

We also expect that you, as a student in this course, will honor and respect
your classmates, abiding by the UCSD Principles of Community
(https://ucsd.edu/about/principles.html).  Please understand that others’
backgrounds, perspectives and experiences may be different than your own, and
help us to build an environment where everyone is respected and feels
comfortable.

If you experience any sort of harassment or discrimination, please contact the
instructor as soon as possible.   If you prefer to speak with someone outside
of the course, please contact the Office of Prevention of Harassment and
Discrimination: https://ophd.ucsd.edu/.
