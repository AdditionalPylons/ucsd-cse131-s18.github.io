In this course, we'll explore the implementation of **compilers**: programs that
transform source programs into other useful, executable forms. This will
include understanding syntax and its structure, checking for and representing
errors in programs, writing programs that generate code, and the interaction
of generated code with a runtime system.

We will explore these topics interactively in lecure, you will implement
an increasingly sophisticated series of compilers throughout the course to
learn how different language features are compiled, and you will think
through design challenges based on what you learn from implementation.

## Schedule

The schedule below outlines topics, due dates, and links to assignments. By
*Monday before class* all due dates, readings, and notable events in the course
until the following Tuesday will be posted. So if you check the schedule at the
beginning of the week, you'll know when all reading quizzes, programming
assignments, etc. will be due. We will often have the schedule confirmed more
than a week out, but we'll always be at least a week ahead.

(The first week is an exception; we'll get everything you need for this week
out by Tuesday evening)

## Staff & Resources

An office hours schedule will be posted here in the first week. If you have
immediate concerns, Joe has office hours from 1-2:30pm on Tuesday the first
week.

## Grading

Your grade will be calculated from:

- 5% participation via clickers
  - Each week both lecture and discussion will have clicker questions. You get
    credit for each session where you answer at least half of the questions.
  - Discussion attendance is not mandatory
- 5% review quizzes
  - Each week there will be an online review quiz, you get full review quiz
    credit for getting at least half the questions right
- 35% programming assignments (7-9 total)
- 20% take home written work
- 15% a midterm exam, in class
- 20% final exam
  - You must score over 50% on the final exam to pass the course
  - If you score higher on the final exam than on the midterm (including 0's on
    the midterm), the final applies at 35%
  - There are no make-up midterms; if you do not take the midterm, you get the
    same score on the midterm as you get on the final

## Policies

### Late Work

You have a total of 4 extension days that you can apply over the course of the
quarter. Any amount of time past the deadline counts as a full day. These apply
to programming assignments and to take-home work. You cannot use more than one
day on a given assignment.

### Regrades

Mistakes occur in grading. Once grades are posted for an assignment, we will
allow a short period for you to request a fix (announced along with grade
release). If you don't make a request in the given period, the grade you were
initially given is final.

### Exams

You are not allowed any study aids on in-class exams, aside from those
pertaining to university-approved accommodations. References will be provided
along with exams to avoid unnecessary memorization.

### Academic Integrity

The academic integrity policy for this course is similar to many other
programming-focused courses. A few notes specific to this course, to be clear:

- You cannot use or consult code from any student in this course or any other
  offering of this course in your solutions.
- You cannot use or consult code from anyone else or from online resources not
  explicitly allowed by the course in your solutions.
- You cannot provide or publish your solutions in a place where other students
  have access you.
- You cannot collaborate on assignments _except_ as explicitly allowed by
  certain assignments, which will be clearly marked.
- No student shall discuss the content or answers of any exam or quiz with any
  other student until after all the exams are graded and returned.  

All of the provisions in [the UCSD
guidelines](http://senate.ucsd.edu/Operating-Procedures/Senate-Manual/Appendices/2)
apply as well.

There may be exceptions to this policy posted clearly on individual assignments
to encourage and enable various kinds of collaboration. The default for
programming assignments is that they will be done individually, and exceptions
to this policy will be announced in advance.
