In this course, we'll explore the implementation of **compilers**: programs that
transform source programs into other useful, executable forms. This will
include understanding syntax and its structure, checking for and representing
errors in programs, writing programs that generate code, and the interaction
of generated code with a runtime system.

We will explore these topics interactively in lecure, you will implement
an increasingly sophisticated series of compilers throughout the course to
learn how different language features are compiled, and you will think
through design challenges based on what you learn from implementation.

## Basics

- Lecture: Center 109, 9am MWF
- Discussion: Center 119, 9am F

- Piazza: <a href="https://piazza.com/class/jfh8ukqgp5h521">https://piazza.com/class/jfh8ukqgp5h521</a>
- Gradescope: <a href="https://www.gradescope.com">https://www.gradescope.com</a> will be used for some submissions (instructions will accompany the first programming assignment)

## Schedule

The schedule below outlines topics, due dates, and links to assignments. Our
promise to you is that by *Monday before class* all due dates, readings, and
notable events in the course until the following Tuesday will be posted. So if
you check the schedule at the beginning of the week, you'll know when all
reading quizzes, programming assignments, etc. will be due. We will often have
the schedule confirmed more than a week out, but we'll always be at least a
week ahead.

## Grading

Your grade will be calculated from:

- 10% participation and review quizzes
  - Each week there will be a review quiz, three lectures, and a discussion
  - You need to get at least 5 points per week to get participation credit for
    the week
  - The review quiz is scored 0-3 points, and you get a -1 if you don't attempt
    it
  - You get 1 point for each lecture and discussion where you attend and answer
    the clicker questions
- 35% programming assignments (7-9 total)
- 20% take home written work
- 10% a midterm exam
- 20% final exam
  - You must score over 50% on the final exam to pass the course
  - If you score higher on the final exam than on the midterm (including 0's on
    the midterm), the final applies at 30%
  - There are no make-up midterms; if you do not take the midterm, you get the
    same score on the midterm as you get on the final

## Policies

### Late Work

You have a total of 4 slip days that you can apply over the course of the
quarter. Any amount of time past the deadline counts as a full day. These apply
to programming assignments and to take-home work. You cannot use more than one
day on a given assignment.

### Regrades

Mistakes occur in grading. Once grades are posted for an assignment, we will
allow a short period for you to request a fix (announced along with grade
release). If you don't make a request in the given period, the grade you were
initially given is final.

### Exams

You are not allowed any study aids on in-class exams, aside from those
pertaining to university-approved accommodations. References will be provided
along with exams to avoid unnecessary memorization.

### Academic Integrity

There are two types of assignments in this course:

- Open collaboration assignments, for which you can talk to anyone else in the
  course, post snippets of code on Piazza, get lots of help from TAs, and
  generally come up with solutions collaboratively. TAs may be able to get you
  unstuck by suggesting very concrete strategies or code. There are a few
  restrictions:
  - Any code that you didn't write must be cited
  - Any in-person conversations you have about the assignment must be noted in
    your README
  - You cannot share an entire repository of code or an entire solution. Keep
    snippets to reasonable, descriptive chunks of code
  - You still _cannot_ use code that you find online. That is, all the code
    that is handed in should be developed by you or someone in the class.
  - You still _cannot_ use code from anyone outside this offering of the
    course.

- Closed collaboration assignments, where you cannot collaborate with others.
  You can ask clarification questions as private posts on Piazza or of TAs.
  However, TAs will not look at your code or comment on it. Lab/office hours
  these weeks are for conceptual questions or for questions about past
  assignments only, no code assistance.

Programming assignments will explicitly list whether they are open or closed
collaboration. There will also be take-home written homeworks, which are always
closed collaboration.

The rationale for these two types of assignment is that programming tasks
traditionally serve two goals: _learning_ and _assessment_. Sometimes these
conflict – getting most or all of the insight from a TA or another student
hampers our ability to assess your work. However, it's useful to ask questions
and get comprehensive explanations while you're working, rather than only after
you've handed something in. So, both kinds of assignments serve a useful
purpose. Typically the open collaboration assignments will be worth less
credit, to reflect the reduced emphasis on assessment.
